## Session: Authentication System Frontend
Date: 2025-08-09
Status: In Progress (5/9 tasks completed)

### Description
Create complete frontend authentication system with login, register, forgot password pages, Google OAuth placeholder, and email verification flow. Includes mock authentication service using localStorage for frontend-only implementation.

### Requirements Clarification ✅
1. **Frontend-only approach**: Mock authentication with localStorage, no backend integration yet
2. **Registration data**: Basic (email, password) + Extended (name, phone, profile picture)
3. **Google OAuth**: Placeholder simulation with mock success flow
4. **Design consistency**: Match current landing page design and component structure
5. **Auth navigation**: Links within auth pages, no new CTAs on landing page
6. **Post-login flow**: Redirect to new dashboard page after successful authentication
7. **Validation**: Basic form validation with email verification UI flow

### Tasks Created
- #T-008 [FEATURE] [HIGH] Create authentication context and mock auth service ✓
- #T-009 [FEATURE] [HIGH] Build Login page with form validation ✓
- #T-010 [FEATURE] [HIGH] Build Register page with extended fields ✓
- #T-011 [FEATURE] [MEDIUM] Create Forgot Password page with email flow UI ✓
- #T-012 [FEATURE] [MEDIUM] Add Google OAuth placeholder integration
- #T-013 [FEATURE] [HIGH] Create new Dashboard page for authenticated users ✓
- #T-014 [TASK] [MEDIUM] Add email verification flow UI components
- #T-015 [TASK] [LOW] Update router with authentication routes and guards
- #T-016 [TASK] [LOW] Add authentication links to login page navigation

### Dependencies
- #T-009 depends on #T-008 (login needs auth context)
- #T-010 depends on #T-008 (register needs auth context)
- #T-011 depends on #T-008 (forgot password needs auth context)
- #T-012 depends on #T-008, #T-009, #T-010 (Google OAuth integrates with auth pages)
- #T-013 depends on #T-008 (dashboard needs auth context for user data)
- #T-014 depends on #T-010 (email verification integrates with registration)
- #T-015 depends on #T-008, #T-009, #T-010, #T-011, #T-013 (router needs all pages)
- #T-016 depends on #T-009, #T-010, #T-011 (navigation needs all auth pages)

### Notes
- Using React Context API for auth state management
- localStorage for mock user data and session persistence
- Component-based architecture following existing patterns (atoms/molecules/organisms)
- Email verification as UI-only flow (no actual email sending)
- Google OAuth button will simulate successful authentication
- Dashboard will be simple welcome page with user info and logout
- All auth pages will have consistent styling with landing page
- Form validation will be real-time for better UX
- Protected routes will redirect unauthenticated users to login
- Auth system designed for easy backend integration later

### Description
Remove the current dashboard completely and add mobile app coming soon section with PlayStore and AppStore in the future features section on landing page. Fix all broken icons throughout the page.

2. **Mobile section placement**: Add to existing future features section on landing page  
3. **App store elements**: Coming soon announcement with store badges
4. **New routing**: `/app/*` routes will redirect temporarily, auth will be added later
