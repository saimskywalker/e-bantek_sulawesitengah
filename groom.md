## Session: Mobile App Coming Soon Feature & Dashboard Removal
Date: 2025-01-08
Status: In Progress (1/7 tasks completed)

### Description
Remove the current dashboard completely and add mobile app coming soon section with PlayStore and AppStore in the future features section on landing page. Fix all broken icons throughout the page.

### Requirements Clarification ✅
1. **Dashboard removal**: Complete removal of dashboard page and routes - new dashboard will be created later
2. **Mobile section placement**: Add to existing future features section on landing page  
3. **App store elements**: Coming soon announcement with store badges
4. **New routing**: `/app/*` routes will redirect temporarily, auth will be added later
5. **Icon fixes**: Replace broken rectangle icons with proper FontAwesome icons
